# Super-Hero-Squad-Service

## Task Description
Have you ever thought about controlling the “Avengers” or “Suicide Squad”? Now is the time, let’s
create a service that controls the power of superheroes and villains squads.
### Models
#### Hero
A hero can be alive, dead, or even injured, a hero can be good or bad, let’s look at Loki
one of Marvel’s heroes, Loki is sometimes good and sometimes bad, he has a power
level that can be compared to another hero in order to determine who is stronger.
#### Squad
A squad is a small group of heroes that share the same goal, every squad has a unique
name such as “The Avengers” or “Ninja Turtles”, and every squad can be resting or
in-action situation.
#### Service
The squad service lets us control the heroes and the squads, make a connection
between squads and heroes, for example, let take a look at “Deadpool”, Deadpool is a
member of the “X-Mans” and a member of “The Avengers”.
The service lets us simulate a battle between 2 squads e.g. “The Avengers” can fight
“The Frightful Four” and the winner will be the stronger squad.
#### Main
A presentation of all the above in any way that you wish.
